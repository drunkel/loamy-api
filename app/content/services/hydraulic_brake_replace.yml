difficulty: "basic"
estimatedTime: "15 minutes"
steps:
  - "Remove the wheel from the bike."
  - "Locate the cotter pin or split pin at the top of the brake caliper and remove it."
  - "Slide out the old brake pads and spring assembly."
  - "Clean the caliper with isopropyl alcohol, ensuring no debris remains."
  - "Use a flat-head screwdriver to gently push the pistons back into the caliper. Be careful not to damage them."
  - "Insert the new brake pads with the spring assembly, ensuring they're oriented correctly."
  - "Reinsert the cotter pin or split pin to secure the pads."
  - "Reinstall the wheel."
  - "Pump the brake lever several times to reset the piston position and check for proper function."
  - "Bed in the new pads by performing several controlled stops from moderate speed."
  - "WARNING: Before starting, check if your brakes use DOT fluid. While Shimano typically uses mineral oil, some other brands use DOT fluid. DOT fluid is hygroscopic and can absorb moisture from the air, potentially leading to brake failure if mishandled. It's also corrosive to paint and can irritate skin and eyes. If your brakes use DOT fluid, wear gloves and eye protection, work in a well-ventilated area, and avoid any contact with the bike's painted surfaces. If you're unsure about the type of fluid or the procedure, it's best to consult a professional bike mechanic."
